# Dancing Salmon

A multi-award winning web application that utilizes multiple APIs to fetch information on a Music Artist, their discography, relevant Music Videos, and upcoming concerts.

Dancing Salmon provides the ability to search for music videos using the Youtube API but also the ability to get information about the artists who made those music videos using the Discogs API.
Dancing Salmon includes a built in search tool which allows users to search for music or artists. Once they find what they are looking for, either they can play music videos of the songs or else get information about the artists and some of their upcoming concerts.
There is also an Internet Radio tool where you can play music from different genres
